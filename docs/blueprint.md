- User Input: Allow each user to input six numerical values into their respective input boxes.

- Accent color: Pale orange (#FFB347) for the 'Calculate' and 'Reset' buttons to draw attention without being overwhelming.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for clean readability.
- Organize input and output fields in a tabular format to maintain clear user association.
- Use minimalist icons for interactive elements, such as a refresh icon for the reset button.
- Subtle animation for formula calculation and output updates to provide visual feedback.
